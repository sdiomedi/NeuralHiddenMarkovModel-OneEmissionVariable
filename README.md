## Introduction
This project implements an HMM to model and analyze spiking neural data, focusing on a single emission variable. The approach is based on the methods detailed in Diomedi et al. (2021).

## Installation
To install and use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sdiomedi/NeuralHiddenMarkovModel-OneEmissionVariable.git
    ```
2. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and add the repository to your MATLAB path:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath('path_to_repository'));
    ```
3. Use the provided scripts and functions to run HMM analysis on your neural data.

## Repository Structure
- `Data`: Sample data for testing the HMM implementation.
- `Functions`: MATLAB functions necessary for the HMM.
- `Script`: Main script to execute the HMM analysis.
